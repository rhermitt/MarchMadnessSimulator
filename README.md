# MarchMadnessSimulator
Welcome to the NCAA March Madness Bracket Simulator. This simulator uses historical probability based on past performances of each seed, along with an element of randomness, to predict who will be victorious in each game of the NCAA Men's basketball tournament. After predicting each game and finally coming up with the winner, the simulator also randomly generates the final score of the championship game since the ESPN tournament challenge requires it as a tiebreaker.
